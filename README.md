# Toxic-Comment-Classification

Welcome to the repository, here we are classifying the Text using 1D Convolutions with Keras from Tensorflow. In this project, 
I have used GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) word embeddings for text classification, used 1D convolutions as feature extractors in natural language processing (NLP), 
and performed binary text classification using deep learning. For this project, I have worked on classifying a large number of Wikipedia comments as being 
either toxic or not (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). This issue is especially important,
given the conversations the global community and tech companies are having on content moderation, online harassment, and inclusivity. 
The data set I used comes from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle.
